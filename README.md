# What is licence in github?
In GitHub, a license is a legal agreement that governs the terms and conditions under which software is made available for use, modification, and distribution. When you create a new repository on GitHub, you have the option to add a license file to your project, which indicates the terms under which your project can be used and distributed.
There are many different open source licenses that you can choose from, each with its own set of conditions and restrictions. Some of the most popular open source licenses include the MIT License, the GNU General Public License (GPL), and the Apache License.

Adding a license to your project can be important because it helps ensure that others who want to use or contribute to your project understand the terms under which they are allowed to do so. It also helps protect your intellectual property and clarifies the responsibilities of users and contributors.
# a)MIT
The MIT License is a permissive open source software license that was originally developed at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). It is a very simple and short license that allows users to freely use, modify, distribute, and sell the software, as long as the original copyright notice and disclaimer of liability are included in the source code and documentation.
# b)BSD
The BSD license is a permissive open source software license that allows users to freely use, modify, and redistribute software, subject to some conditions. It is named after the Berkeley Software Distribution, a Unix operating system developed at the University of California, Berkeley.
There are several variants of the BSD license, but they all have a few key characteristics in common. Like the MIT License, the BSD license is considered a permissive license because it places relatively few restrictions on what users can do with the software.
# c)APACHE
The Apache License is an open source software license that was originally developed by the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) for use with Apache web server software. It is a permissive license that allows users to freely use, modify, and distribute software, subject to some conditions.

The Apache License has several variants, but they all have a few key characteristics in common. The Apache License is a permissive license that allows users to do almost anything they want with the software, as long as they follow a few basic rules.
